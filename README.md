## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works
Driver Sathi consists of three integrated components:
1. **Python Detection Engine:** Uses OpenCV and dlib to detect eye closure patterns in real-time.
2. **React Frontend:** Provides a UI with a "Run Demo" button and live state feedback.
3. **Node.js Backend:** Manages the Python script and serves the frontend.

> Webcam access requires local execution due to browser restrictions.
